Welcome to my Portfolio Page, my name is Alexandre Farias and I'm a Data Scientist with a Master Degree in Computational Intelligence from Universidade Federal do Par√° (UFPA). I have a big interest in Natural Language Processing, Business Intelligence and Medical Research.\
My experience includes a good knowledge on Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning, working with Python, R, Scala and MATLAB, where I've developed CRM systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, Sports Analysis, Recommendation Systems, Forecasting Models and Medical Predictive Systems.\
Beyond Machine Learning, I have experience with containers (Docker), Nature Inspired Optimization Algorithms, Databases (SQL and NoSQL), Web Scraping and DevOps Culture.\
In this Portfolio you can see my Personal Projects and Accolades.

## Data Science Projects

* **Customer Churn Prediction**\
An implementation of customer churn prediction using Boosting Ensemble of Logistic Regressions. Also, an Exploratory Data Analysis is made to understand the impact of contracts types and payment methods on churned clients.\
This work was added to the Open Source Python Module PyCaret as one of the [examples on its official repository](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/blob/master/examples/PyCaret%202%20Customer%20Churn%20Prediction.ipynb).\

* **Public Bids Anomaly Detection**\
This work has as objetive make an analysis on the public bids of the Brazilian State Rio Grande do Sul.
An Anomaly Detection Model is built to identify suspicious items bought on bids.\
The datasets contain text and numerical features about the bids description and items bought for the years of 2016 to 2019.\
For the analysis, the text features are analyzed for specific recurrent set of words, like items and public organ names, and for numerical features, the item costs.\
The anomaly detection is made using the iforest algorithm and later a classification with XGBoost.\

* **Text Similarity Classification**\
Text similarity classification where an Exploratory Data Analysis is made to analyze character length effects on target classes and Topic Modelling using LDA to extract features from texts, to use they on a Bagging Ensemble of CatBoost Classifiers to check if the texts are similars. \
This work was added to the Open Source Python Module PyCaret as one of the [examples on its official repository](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/blob/master/examples/PyCaret%202%20Text%20Similarity%20Classification.ipynb).\

* **HuffPost News Classification**\
A category classification of the news posted in HuffPost using their Headlines and Short Descriptions. The classification is made using [DistillBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) pre-trained Deep Learning network.\
To help on the data understanding for model build, an Exploratory data analysis is made to analyze characters by news cateogry and the news posted through the years on HuffPost. \
This work was developed using the Python Deep Learning Frameworks [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst).\

* **Fewer Injuries, More Touchdowns: NFL Data Analytics**\
This work was my contribution to [NFL 1st and Future - Analytics Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-playing-surface-analytics) hosted on Kaggle, where many features are analyzed, as Turf, Speed, etc., to determine how a player gets an injury.\
A highlight on this work is my take on reconstruct the `PlayKey` missing values, where I analyzed how the feature was was built based on other features. \
All this is only based on Data Analysis with Data features distribution by categories, features histograms, player's routes and features correlation.\

* **Movie Recommendation System with ALS in PySpark**\
It's a Movie Recommendation System using [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) from Kaggle.\ The objective of this work is show how PySpark is effective to build recommendation systems with Collaborative Filtering. \
An Exploratory Data Analysis is made to get insights about the dataset and the system is built using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm.\
The recommendations are showed as User Based and Item based.\

* **Brazilian Products Export Forecasting**\
Forecasting for exported brazilian products using the Prophet Python module developed by Facebook.\
This work uses covariates as countries GDPs to aid on the forecasting accuracy for the next 10 years.\
An Exploratory Data Analysis is made to gain insights about the exported products, as what country is a good trader.\
